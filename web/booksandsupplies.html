    <h2></h2>
    <p>Most of our classes provide printed materials and do not require a
        purchase of a textbook or a workbook.
        Should your child need a textbook or a workbook for a specific
        class, the teacher will discuss it with you individually.
        School provides books directly from distributors at a very good
        discounted price.
